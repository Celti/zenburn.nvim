Zenburn
=======

A port of the venerable [Zenburn](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn)
colorscheme to lua.

Zenburn is a low-contrast color scheme for Vim. Itâ€™s easy for your eyes and
designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.

The aim of this port is to bring Zenburn into the modern age, with support for
[Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) and many
more plugins.

Setup
-----

```vim
colorscheme zenburn
```

With lua

require("zenburn").setup()
```

Plugin Support
--------------

The following plugins are currently supported:

* [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
* [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
* [indent-blankline](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim)
* [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)
* [nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)
* [symbols-outline](https://github.com/simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim)

Status
------

I consider this software to be in *Alpha*. The core colors are basically
a straight port from the original Zenburn theme for vim, so I don't expect any
major issues. However, the plugin schemes are not widely tested yet and subject
to changes.

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are always welcome, especially for additional plugins. Please
include one or more screenshots showcasing your contribution.

Zenburn already has a rather large palette. I'm trying to avoid color bloat,
so please don't add any new colors if at all possible and refer to existing
ones instead.
